  <h2 class='c006'>1. <span class='sc'>Dr. Burgess, the present Bishop of Salisbury, on Colonial Slavery.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> our last Number we adduced the testimony of many distinguished
prelates of the Church of England against the evils of Slavery. There
remains one living Prelate whom it would be unpardonable for us to
omit; we mean the present Bishop of Salisbury, Dr. Burgess. In the
year 1789, this learned and excellent person published a pamphlet,
which we fear has been long out of print, and is only now to be found
in such libraries as that of the British Museum, entitled, “Considerations
on the abolition of <i>Slavery</i>, and the Slave Trade, upon grounds of
natural, religious, and political duty.” A Liverpool Clergyman of the
name of Harris, had published a pamphlet in defence of slavery, which
he represented as a dispensation of Providence,—a state of society recognised
by the Gospel;—in which the reciprocal duties of masters
and slaves are founded on the principle of both being servants of Christ,
and are enforced by the Divine rules of Christian charity. The following
are some of the indignant observations of the good Bishop, on witnessing
such a prostitution of the sacred truths and obligations of religion:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reciprocal duties!” he exclaims, “Reciprocal duties!—To have an adequate
sense of the propriety of these terms, we must forget the humane provisions of
the Hebrew law, as well as the liberal indulgence of Roman slavery, and think
only of <span class='sc'>West India slavery</span>! of <i>unlimited</i>, <i>uncompensated</i>, <i>brutal</i> slavery, and
then judge what <i>reciprocity</i> there can be between absolute authority and absolute
subjection; and how the Divine rule of Christian charity can be said to enforce
the <i>reciprocal duties</i> of the West India slave and his master. Reciprocity is inconsistent
with every degree of real slavery.” “Slavery cannot be called one of
the species of civil subordination. A slave is a non-entity in civil society.”
“Law and slavery are contradictory terms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bishop’s treatise is one among many proofs that the Abolitionists
<i>from the first</i> contemplated the ultimate extinction of slavery as the end
of their labours.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such oppression,” says the Bishop, (meaning the state of slavery), “and
such traffic” (meaning the slave trade), “must be swept away at one blow. Such
horrid offences against God and nature can admit of no medium. Yet some of
the more moderate apologists of slavery think that a medium may be adopted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>They think that slavery ought not to be abolished, but modified and
meliorated by good laws and regulations. It is well observed by
Cicero, that ‘incidunt multæ sæpe causæ quæ conturbent animos
utilitatis specie, non cum hoc deliberetur, Relinquendane sit honestas
propter utilitatis magnitudinem (nam id quidem improbum est,) sed
illud, Possitne id quod utile videatur fieri non turpiter.’ But it is
impossible for slavery ‘fieri non turpiter.’” pp. 82, 83.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bishop proceeds to observe, that “All the laws hitherto made, have produced
little or no benefit to the slaves. But there are many reasons why it is
very improbable that such provisions <i>should</i> produce any effectual benefit. The
power which is exercised over the slaves, and the severe coercion necessary to
keep an immense superiority of numbers in absolute obedience to a few, and restrain
them from insurrection, are incompatible with justice or humanity, and
are obnoxious to abuses which no legal regulations can counteract. The power
which a West Indian master has over his slave, it is impossible for the generality
of masters or managers not to abuse. It is too great to be intrusted in the
hands of men subject to human passions and infirmities. The best principles
and most generous natures are perverted by the influence of passion and habit.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote c000' id='f1'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The poet Cowper seems to have entertained much the same opinion as the
Bishop of Salisbury; for in one of his Letters, dated April, 1788, we find him
saying: “Laws will, I suppose, be enacted for the more humane treatment of the
Negroes; but who shall see to the execution of them? The planters will not,
and the Negroes cannot. In fact, we know that laws of this tendency have not
been wanting, enacted even amongst themselves; but there has been always a
want of prosecutors, or righteous judges, deficiencies which will not be very
easily supplied. The newspapers have lately told us, that these merciful masters,
have on this occasion, been occupied in passing ordinances, by which the
lives and limbs of their slaves are to be secured from wanton cruelty hereafter.
But who does not immediately detect the artifice, or can give them a moment’s
credit for any thing more than a design, by this show of lenity to avert the storm
which they think hangs over them? On the whole, I fear there is reason to wish,
for the honour of England, that the nuisance had never been troubled; lest we
eventually make ourselves justly chargeable with the whole offence by not removing
it. The enormity cannot be palliated: we can no longer plead that we
were not aware of it, or that our attention was otherwise engaged; and shall be
inexcusable, therefore, ourselves, if we leave the least part of it unredressed.
Such arguments as Pharaoh might have used, to justify his destruction of the
Israelites, substituting sugar for bricks, (‘ye are idle; ye are idle,’) may lie
ready for our use also; but I think we can find no better.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>If these arguments of the Bishop be well founded, it follows, first,
that the great mark at which every friend of humanity ought to aim,
by all lawful expedients, is complete and irrevocable emancipation;
secondly, that in the interim, as laws, when committed to the guardianship
of the slave-holder, are merely waste paper, the Government and
Legislature of this country should take the matter into their own hands,
and shape their course to an ultimate extinction of an evil from which
they cannot extract all the venom but by slaying the hydra itself; and
thirdly, that too much weight should not be given to the representations
of persons even of the “best principles and most generous natures,”
when “perverted by the influence of passion and habit,” to apologize
for, or wish to perpetuate, the enormities of this accursed system.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Bishop in reply to those who defend or connive at West India
slavery as a “dispensation of Providence,” and as, indirectly at least,
sanctioned by the word of God, observes,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Many attacks,” says his lordship, “have been made on the authority of
Scripture; but nothing would more effectually subvert its authority than to prove
that its injunctions are inconsistent with the common principles of benevolence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>and inimical to the general rights of mankind. It would degrade the sanctity of
Scripture; it would reverse all our ideas of God’s paternal attributes, and all
arguments for the Divine origin of the Christian religion drawn from its precepts
of universal charity and benevolence.” “That any custom so repugnant to the
natural rights of mankind as the slave trade, <i>or slavery the source and support of
the slave trade</i>, should be thought to be consonant to the principles of natural
and revealed religion, is a paradox which it is difficult to reconcile with the
reverence due to the records of our holy religion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His Lordship then proceeds to shew, 1st, That slavery and the slave trade are
inconsistent with the principles of nature (in allusion to his opponent’s argument),
deducible from Scripture. 2d. That no conclusion can be drawn in favour
of West India slavery or the African slave trade (which the Bishop always
classes and brands together) from particular transactions recorded in Scripture;
both because the trade in slaves bears no resemblance to the slavery and slave
trade in question, and because transactions merely recorded in Scripture history
are not sanctioned by the record. 3d, That no conclusion can be formed from
Hebrew laws respecting West Indian Slavery, because the conditions are by no
means analogous; and because, even if they were, laws neither introduce nor
justify every custom which they regulate. 4th, That the clearest and fullest
permission of slavery to the Jews under the Law of Moses does not make it
allowable to Christians, because the new law has succeeded to the ritual and
judicial ordinances of the old; and we cannot reason from one state of things
to another when any great revolution has intervened in the progress of religion.
5th, That, however such permission might appear to make slavery in any degree
allowable to the first Hebrew Christians under the Roman government, it does
not by any means make it allowable under the free government of this country,
because we cannot reason from one form of government to another. 6th, That
whatever may be the commercial and national advantages of slavery, (which
however the Bishop does not estimate very highly: on the contrary, he strongly
insists on its improvidence, and the vast superiority of free labour,) it ought not
to be tolerated, because of the inadequacy of those advantages to their many bad
effects and consequences. 7th, That slavery and the slave trade ought to be
abolished on account of the good which would follow to religion, to mankind,
and to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have not space to condense the whole of the Bishop’s arguments,
but we shall present our readers with a few succinct notices. As for
the atrocities of the African slave trade, or the cruelties of West India
slavery, he says there is nothing in Scripture that is parallel to either;
but he argues that “slavery itself (in every form) is inconsistent with
the law of nature deducible from Scripture, and therefore with the will
of God;” and that, therefore, “<i>much more so</i> are the cruelties of West
India slavery, and the African slave trade.” Slavery, he further remarks,
“even in its mildest sense, considered as unlimited, involuntary,
uncompensated subjection to the service of another, is a total annihilation
of all natural rights.” This forcible abduction of liberty, he contends,
is inconsistent with the natural rights of society, as deducible
from Scripture. In God’s first commission to man he gave him dominion
over the brute creation; but there is no expression by which Adam
or any of his posterity could collect that they had a right of dominion
over their own species. The extent of this primary charter, remarks
the Bishop, cannot be more forcibly expressed than in the language of
our great poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O execrable son, so to aspire</div>
      <div class='line'>Above his brother! to himself assuming</div>
      <div class='line'>Authority usurped, from God not given.</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave us only over beasts, flesh, fowl,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dominion absolute. That right we hold</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>By his donation: but man over man</div>
      <div class='line'>He made not lord; such title to himself</div>
      <div class='line'>Reserving, human left from human free.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To those advocates of slavery who would use in its favour the golden
rule of doing as we would be done by, the Bishop in reply exclaims,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Detestable perversion ... of the most benevolent of all precepts!” Yet there
is one very obvious view, he adds, in which the precept applies to the case of
slavery; “for as no person would wish to be reduced to slavery <i>or to continue
so</i>, no person whatever should reduce, a fellow-creature to slavery <i>or keep him in
that condition</i>.” “The precept may enjoin the submission of the slave to his master,
but it does not enjoin slavery: it neither makes the occasion nor justifies it.
Submission is a virtue in a slave; but the exercise of this virtue neither justifies
the making of slaves nor the keeping of them. Offences must come, and injustice
will prevail; but woe be to them by whom the offences come! It should not
be forgotten that, if the precept enjoins submission in the slave, it applies
<i>doubly</i> to the master; for it enjoins humanity in the treatment of his slaves, <span class='fss'>AND
CONDEMNS HIM FOR KEEPING THEM AT ALL</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That the slaves are in a happier condition, and “far better off than
the British peasantry,” is another old argument, which has of late
been newly furbished; and the Bishop of Salisbury well replies
to it, as well as to the absurd opinion, that where there is no positive
physical cruelty, (and would there were nothing even of this!) there is
nothing to complain of.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If no <i>other</i> circumstance could be proved,” says the Bishop, “yet the mere
privation of liberty, and compulsion to labour without compensation, is great
cruelty and oppression. If no other fault could be alleged, the involuntary
submission of so many thousands to a few individuals implies, beyond a doubt,
the employment of means the most tyrannical and oppressive to secure such subjection.”
“The condition of West India slaves,” he continues, “some of the
apologists for slavery have endeavoured to recommend, by asserting that the
slaves are happier than the poor of our own country. However inadvertently
this opinion may have been admitted by many, it could have originated only
from the possession of inordinate authority and insensibility to the blessings of
a free country. Where the poor slaves are considered mere brutes of burden, it
is no wonder that their happiness should be measured by the regular supply of
mere animal subsistence. But the miseries of cold and want are light when
compared with the miseries of a mind weighed down by irresistible oppression.
The hardships of poverty are every day endured by thousands in this country
for the sake of that liberty which the advocates of slavery think of so little value
in their estimation of others’ happiness, rather than relinquish their right to their
<i>own</i> time, their <i>own</i> hovel, and their <i>own</i> scanty property, to become the pensioners
of a parish. And yet an English poor-house has advantages of indulgence
and protection which are incompatible with the most humane system of
West India slavery. <i>To place the two situations of the English poor and West
India slaves in any degree of comparison, is a defamation of our laws, and an insult
to the genius of our country.</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bishop goes on to point out that “the inconsistency between slavery and
the slave trade, and <i>the general principles of our law and constitution</i>; between the
<i>permission</i> of such usages and <i>our high pretensions to civil liberty</i>; appears to furnish
arguments for the abolition of slavery, not less powerful on the one hand,
than the injunctions of Scripture and the rights of nature on the other.” “If
slavery, <i>however modified</i>, is suffered to exist, British law cannot be in force.
Why then attempt to modify what is in its very principle inhuman, unchristian,
and inconsistent with British law, and the spirit of our constitution; <i>and
which, however its concomitant circumstances might be diminished, could never be
rendered not inhuman, not unchristian, not unconstitutional</i>? If justice to our
nature, to our religion, and our country demand the sacrifice, why should an act
of such accumulated duty be done by halves? Why not rather, by one generous
effort of public virtue, cut off all occasion of inhumanity and oppression, with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>the pernicious effects of slavery on the slave, the master, and the state?” “Even
if the experience of two centuries did not forbid us to suppose that the <i>abuses</i>,
as they are called, of slavery and the slave trade, could be effectually checked
and prevented by legal authority, yet the very nature of the offence complained
of resists the supposition. Oppression, cruelty, the degradation of the human
species, <i>and repugnance of the British constitution</i>, are evils inseparable from
slavery and the slave trade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bishop even apprehends injury to the mother country, by the baneful reaction
of her colonial slave system. He dreads the influence of West Indian
residents on their return to England. “The air even of this land of liberty,”
he remarks, “may not be able to dissipate their West Indian habits of absolute
dominion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these views of the subject, our readers cannot wonder that the
Bishop maintains, that “no British subject can be exempt from the
duty of doing every thing in his power towards procuring the abolition
both of West Indian slavery and the slave trade; customs in every way
repugnant to religion, humanity, and freedom.” He particularly urges
the subject upon his brethren of the sacred order.—The clergy, it seems,
had been reproached by the West Indian party for their zealous efforts
for the abolition of the slave trade and slavery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop vindicates them; remarking, that if <i>no</i> British subject is “exempt
from the duty of doing every thing in his power towards preventing the continuance
of so great a political as well as moral evil, more especially are not those
subjects whose business it is to teach what it is every man’s concern to know;
the interpreters of God’s word, which is so flagrantly violated by West Indian
slavery and its consequences.” “Instead of wishing to restrain the exertions of
any order of men or individuals, in this cause of human nature, let us rather of
all ranks, professions and persuasions unite—in the name of the <i>common Father</i>
of mankind—in the name of Him who died to save us all—in the name of Faith,
of Charity, and of Liberty, to implore those who have the power, to extirpate a
system of cruelty and oppression which has been so long suffered to exist, to the
dishonour of human nature, the discredit of a Christian nation, of a generous
and enlightened people, and the disgrace of a free constitution!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whether,” observes the good Bishop, “all the cruelties imputed to the slave
trade, and to Slavery, can or cannot be substantiated; whether the cruelties
complained of can be mitigated or not; <i>the very existence of slavery</i>, as long as
it is permitted, must be a heavy reproach to this country, and a discredit to the
age which can tolerate it.” “Whatever a Machiavellian in politics or commerce”
may urge to the contrary, “slavery ought to be abolished, because inconsistent
with the will of God.” It is not a question, he contends, to be argued
merely by statesmen and publicists, but the “natural and scriptural illegality”
of slavery may be judged of “on grounds infinitely superior to all commercial
considerations (as much superior as the soul is to the body, as the interests of
eternity are to the concerns of a day,) by every one that can feel for his fellow
creatures, and can be determined by every one that can read the Scriptures.”
And, adds his lordship, whatever opposition may be made by interested persons
for a time, “we cannot doubt that the great principles of political justice which
form the basis of our constitution, and which ought to come home to the breast
of every British subject, will have their full weight in the deliberations of those
august assemblies which are to decide on a cause that involves the purity of our
holy religion, and the credit and consistency of our national character.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty years of most opprobrious supineness and indifference have
passed over our heads since the pious Bishop made this manly and
forcible appeal to the national conscience. We trust, that now, in the
evening of his days, he may have an opportunity of sealing, by an effective
vote, the final extinction of the evil which, in earlier life, he so
powerfully exposed.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>2. <span class='sc'>Appeal to the Bench of Bishops on Colonial Slavery, by Granville Sharpe.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The character of Granville Sharpe is too well known to require any
prefatory observations. A reference to his authority may form no unappropriate
supplement to the extracts we have given from the pamphlet
of the Bishop of Salisbury, who was the friend and the fellow
labourer of that great philanthropist. In the year 1788, Granville
Sharpe published a work entitled, “The Law of Retribution, or a Serious
Warning to Great Britain and her Colonies, founded on unquestionable
examples of God’s temporal vengeance against tyrants, slave-holders,
and oppressors.” He commences his warning with the following
passage of Scripture:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The people of the land have used <i>oppression</i>, and exercised <i>robbery</i>, and
have <i>vexed the poor and needy</i>; yea, they have <i>oppressed the stranger wrongfully</i>,
and I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand
in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed
them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their
heads, saith the Lord <span class='sc'>God</span>.” Ezekiel xxii. 29-31.</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the conclusion of the work, after applying and repeating this
text, he thus addresses the Right Reverend the Bench of Bishops:</p>

<p class='c008'>“And have not the inhabitants of <i>Great Britain</i> and her Colonies, just reason
to expect a <i>similar</i> vengeance for the <i>like oppressions</i>? Do they flatter themselves
that the <i>same God</i> will permit them to go on without <i>recompensing</i> their ‘own
way’ upon their heads? <i>Slavery</i> for <i>Slavery</i>? Or have they forgot, that the God
of Israel, who thus reproved his peculiar people for holding their <i>brethren</i> in
bondage, is the same ‘Lord God’ <i>with whom we have to do</i>? And that he is unchangeable?
How would our rulers and chief men bear a repetition of this
unchangeable <i>word</i> in the presence of God, when the Books are opened for
judgment:—‘<i>I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge, and
stand</i> in the gap <i>before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I</i> found
none!’ May I not say, that even ‘<i>backsliding Israel</i>’ shall ‘<i>rise up in judgment
with this generation, and shall condemn it?</i>’ As ‘<i>the backsliding Israel
hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah</i>,’ (Jer. iii. 11.) so she hath
surely ‘justified herself more than’ Britain! for when the measure of her iniquity
seemed to be filled by that notorious act of <i>oppression</i> in the reign of Pekah before
mentioned, there were yet found in her four <i>worthy advocates</i> ‘to stand in
the gap <i>before</i> God <i>for the Land</i>;’ even four ‘<i>chiefs</i>’ (or Nobles) ‘<i>of the children
of Ephraim</i>,’ who boldly <i>protested</i> against the horrid crime of domestic <i>slavery</i>.
But <i>Great Britain</i>, though staggering under a much heavier load of the same
kind of guilt has not proºduced, out of her numerous <i>Peerage</i>, one single chief to
stand up ‘<i>for the land</i>,’ and remove her burden! Mark this ye Right Reverend
Fathers of our Church, who sit with the Princes <i>of the Realm</i> to consult the
welfare of the state! Think not that I am inclined through any misguided prejudice
to charge <i>your order</i>, in particular, with the omission. The <i>crying sin</i> has
hitherto been far distant from your <i>sight</i>, and perhaps was never fully represented
to you, or like <i>faithful watchmen of Israel</i>, you would long ago have
warned our nation of the danger: but I now call upon you, in the name of God,
for assistance! <i>Ye know the Scriptures</i>, and therefore to you, my Lords, in particular
I appeal! If I have misrepresented <i>the word of God</i>, on which my <i>opposition
to</i> slavery is founded, point out my errors, and I submit: but if, on the
other hand, you should perceive that the texts here quoted are really applicable
to the question before us, that my conclusions from thence are fairly drawn, and
that the examples of God’s vengeance against tyrants and slave-holders ought
strictly to warn us against <i>similar oppressions</i> and <i>similar vengeance</i>, you will
not then, I trust, be backward <i>in this cause of</i> God <i>and</i> Man. <i>Stand up</i> (let me
entreat you) ‘<i>for the land</i>; make up the hedge,’ to save your country; perhaps it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>is not yet too late! Enter a solemn protest, my Lords, against those who ‘<i>have
oppressed the stranger wrongfully</i>.’ Ye know that the testimonies I have quoted
are of God! Warn, therefore, the nobles and Senators of these Kingdoms, that
they incur not a double load of guilt; as the burden, not only of the <i>much injured
African strangers</i>, but also of our country’s ruin, must rest on the heads of
those who withhold their testimony against the crying sin of tolerated slavery!
For ‘I know that the Lord will maintain the cause <i>of the</i> afflicted, and the right
of the poor.’” Ps. cxl. 12.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>3. <span class='sc'>Fresh Atrocities in Berbice.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Berbice has been one of the colonies which has boasted the most
of its humanity, but which, to say the least, has been not <i>less</i> distinguished
for its cruelties than the other colonies. Its Memorial to the
Privy Council, in 1827, was loud in professions of tenderness for the
feelings of the slaves, notwithstanding the recency of those reports of
its Fiscal which filled this country with horror. (See Reporters, Nos. 5
and 16.) Later reports from this colony continue, as may be seen in the
Anti-Slavery Reporter, No. 43, to be marked by the same disgusting characters
of brutal ferocity and of callous indifference to negro comfort as
the former. And an occurrence, which has taken place there so recently
as November last, will plainly shew how little amendment in the state of
the slaves in that colony has been derived from the Order in Council.</p>

<p class='c013'>A colonist, of the name of Gallez, who is himself of mixed blood,
was the proprietor of a large body of slaves. He had prevailed on
these slaves to agree, though most reluctantly, to accompany him to
a wood-cutting establishment, called Catherinasburgh, which he formed
in the interior about sixty or seventy miles up the Canye river, and far
removed, therefore, from other plantations. The situation, however,
was healthy, provision-grounds were abundant, and the water was of the
finest kind. Mr. Gallez had also shewn a wish to procure religious instruction
for his slaves, and to introduce marriage among them. His
extraction created a sympathy with them; and he is said to have lived
among them as a father. This is the account of one who does not altogether
judge by the colonial standard of paternity. He erected good
houses for them; allotted them fertile grounds; and as he conducted
his wood-cutting in the way of moderate task, they had time to labour
for themselves, and were living in abundance. They seem almost
to have realized the picture drawn by Dr. Pinkard, of the Profit
plantation in <i>his</i> time, though, unhappily, they now share the fate of
the Profit negroes.—Mr. Gallez had embarked in some speculations
which involved him in pecuniary difficulties, and by an order of the
Court of Justice, his slaves were placed under sequestration, and a
certain portion of them, (not the whole together, and along with the
plantation, but a part of them,) was marked out for sale in November
last. No previous inquiry seems to have been made into their circumstances,
in order to avoid dissevering the ties of kindred and affection.
But a peremptory mandate required that they should quit their
houses, their fields, their connexions, and appear at New Amsterdam
on the specified day to be exposed to sale, in lots, to the best bidder.
When this mandate, which was wholly unexpected by them, was communicated
to the slaves, by the officers of the Court, who went to seize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>and bring to sale their destined victims, the whole gang, amounting to
upwards of two hundred, retired into the almost impenetrable woods
which surround the plantation; so that the seizure became impossible.
When the officers returned to town, and reported the circumstance, the
affair was magnified into a serious insurrection, which, if unsubdued,
would spread fire and sword through the colony; and the cry arose for
prompt military execution on the daring rebels, and for the arrest and
punishment of Mr. Gallez himself, who, it was then remembered to
his disadvantage, had been favourable to religious instruction, to
marriage, and other reforms; and who, it was therefore assumed as a
matter of course, must, like the murdered missionary Smith, have been
the fomenter of the insurrection. Urgent application was made for a
military detachment to be immediately sent to avert the danger, and
this course would, probably, have been pursued, had not the Governor
been led to see the propriety of first trying the effect of civil interference.
Accordingly, the Fiscal, the Protector of slaves, and some others, were
sent to the spot in order to induce their quiet submission. These
gentlemen accordingly proceeded to Catherinasburgh; and on their
arrival, the whole of the slaves readily appeared before them. It was
explained to them that the debts of their master had led to the order of
Court for taking a portion of them from the rest, and from their houses
and grounds, and selling them; and that the law, they must be aware,
could not be resisted without bringing ruin on themselves and their
families. The slaves ably and feelingly stated their case. They pointed
to the superior comforts they possessed over those living on the sugar
and coffee estates below. They pleaded also their services to the colony
in rooting out a maroon town some time back, for which medals had
been bestowed on them by the Government. All this was admitted,
but it was urged in reply, that their master was the real author of the
evil, by having made them over to his creditors, and no remedy could
now be applied. After some farther discussion, the poor creatures
agreed to submit to their fate; and, in three or four days, they were
embarked on board boats, and carried to the place of sale. The parting
scene would beggar description. Those who were doomed to the
hammer and to be scattered over the colony, as well as those who remained,
were equally loud and vociferous in their wailing, so that even
the whites, who were present, felt the infection of their grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>What a picture of slavery in its best state! We trust we shall have
the official details of this transaction, laid on the table of Parliament.
In the mean time, is it irrelevant to remark, that the atrocity, in this
case, is the result, not of individual oppression, but of the iniquity of
the colonial law, and that, in a colony where his Majesty, by his ministers,
is the sole legislator; and into which these ministers have recently
introduced what is called an improved slave code? The present
slave law of Berbice has emanated from the Crown, and yet, under
that law, with all its professed designs of amelioration and protection,
we here see the wretched, helpless, and degraded state in which it has
still left the subjects of the King;—beasts of the field, chattels, bereft
of every civil and social, and even domestic, right; and though endowed
with the faculties and capacities, and heirs to the common destinies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>of men, yet depressed, by the very law which ought to protect them, to
the level of the brutes that perish. Is not such legislation a mockery of
the very name of law? Or can such legislation be considered as a redemption
of the solemn pledge given by his Majesty’s Government and
Parliament in 1823? And what hope can we indulge, that in colonies
having legislatures of their own, we shall witness any other than a
delusive shew of improvement, while such examples as these are furnished
in colonies directly governed by the Crown itself? We would
entreat our readers to look at Berbice as it stands painted, not in our
statements, but in the simple and unsophisticated details of its own
Fiscal, (see Reporter, No. 5, and No. 16) and again of its Protector,
even in the last year, (see No. 43,) and, combining these details with
the transaction of which we have now given a brief account, to say
whether such a state of things can be endured? We call especially
on the ministers of the Crown to look calmly at these facts, and to say,
whether they are not responsible, if not for the existence, at least for
the continuance for a single day longer, of such tremendous evils?</p>

<p class='c013'>The occurrences in Berbice are only inferior in atrocity to the horrors
of the Mauritius. And wherein does the state of slavery of Berbice
differ from that of our other West India colonies, but in our having
happily obtained thence those details which are carefully withheld from
us in almost every other case? Let us obtain similar details from the
other colonies, and we shall find them to exhibit the same state of legal
oppression, the same affecting accumulation of individual misery as exists
in Berbice. Mr. Dwarris, indeed, vaunts loudly of improvement in the
colonies. Improvement! The pretence to it, in the face of such facts,
is an insult to common sense; and the improvement, we fear, is to
be found mainly, if not solely, in the increased obtuseness and callousness
of feeling, which those must acquire who are the hourly spectators
and actors in this grand theatre of crime.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>4. <span class='sc'>Recent Intelligence from Jamaica.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'>1. <i>Colonial Policy.</i></h3>

<p class='c009'>In the Jamaica Gazette of the 20th of December, 1828, is inserted
a letter from London, dated no longer ago than November last, in which
the writer seems to be thinking aloud, unconscious of the presence of
any anti-slavery auditor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This critical state of affairs,” (he says, alluding to Ireland,) “together with
the threatening aspect which Europe is assuming, will no doubt tend to divert
public attention from the Colonial Question, at least during the next session;
and let us hope, that, by the time these matters are settled, others will arise to
engage the good people of England in the laudable task of minding and <i>mending</i>
their own affairs, instead of <i>quacking</i> with the colonies! Of course, we
must expect the annual repetition of some of the rigmarole philippics of Buxton,
Brougham, or Lushington, but these carry with them little terror now. The
party are evidently losing ground—the mania has gone by—it is no longer a
successful theme for popular declamation, and, although I cannot say any decided
<i>reaction</i> has taken place in the public mind, yet the fervid zeal has settled
down into calm indifference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The bulk of the people are <i>passive</i> on the subject, and I am persuaded will
remain so. They are quite satiated with colonial horrors. The rancour of our
enemies continues, and <i>will continue</i>, unabated, but their influence is considerably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>modified. No doubt, they will still trump up annual petitions against
slavery, but these are no longer considered the criterion of public opinion, and
have consequently no influence with Government. It is quite amusing to witness
the despicable arts the anti-colonists resort to, in order to obtain signatures
to these insidious memorials. In some places they have a table in the open
street, on which the paper is laid, and the labouring classes, in returning from
work, are solicited to affix their names, with so much suavity of manner—such
bland persuasiveness, that there is no resisting, and many of the creatures, who
are thus entrapped, do not even know the object of the paper they are signing.
I heard of one fellow, who, in haranguing a mob collected round one of their
tables, actually expatiated on the enormity of continuing the slave <i>trade</i>,” (and
is not a slave trade carried on in Jamaica?) “and urged his colleagues to sign
the petition, which was to put an end to this inhuman <i>traffic</i>! and really the
ignorance of even the well-informed classes, on this subject, is quite astonishing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our object ought to be” (and doubtless is in all their measures) “to <i>gain
time</i>, for, the longer the main question is delayed, the better it will be understood
by the British public, and the more likely they will be to be influenced by
<i>principle</i> rather than by <i>passion and prejudice</i> in their decision. This object
would be more effectually secured, and our adversaries more completely disarmed,
if the Colonial Assemblies would, from time to time, engage themselves
in correcting the old abuses in the system, and in making such improvements as
would be commensurate with the advancement of the slaves in the scale of
civilization.” (This we have always said has been their policy.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course it has not transpired here what instructions have been sent out to
Sir John Keane as to the rejected Slave Bill; but I trust the odious mandate,
which gave such offence last year has been rescinded, and that our House of
Assembly have repassed the bill in its original form.” (Precisely what they have
done.) “The West Indians here are in high spirits about the appointment of
the new Governor—they expect great things from him, judging by his general
character. It was intended that he should go out in time to open the Assembly,
but, as this could not be accomplished in time, he will not, I understand, sail
till the end of November.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>2. <i>Persecution of Missionaries.</i></h3>

<p class='c009'>The Assembly of Jamaica appear to have acted in strict conformity
with the above suggestions. The disallowed slave law of 1826, has
been re-enacted without the change of a single clause. The object in
doing so is evidently to gain time, trusting to the chapter of accidents
for future occasions of delay. It being expedient, however, to supply
some reasons for so directly flying in the face of His Majesty’s Government,
as to re-enact verbatim et literatim the persecuting clauses of
1826, which were directed to the suppression of the missions of
methodists and dissenters, and to the consequent exclusion of the slaves
from effective religious instruction, the assembly, in its wisdom, has had
recourse as usual to the getting up of such ex-parte statements as the
case seemed to call for, and which there never is any difficulty of procuring
in Jamaica. And here we do them the justice to believe, that
they had too much good sense to expect, that the statements thus prepared
would be received in this country as evidence in <i>proof</i> of their
charges against the missionaries. It was quite enough that they served
to give a colour to the contumacious re-enactment of the rejected clauses.
Accordingly a Committee of the House of Assembly was appointed “to
inquire into the establishment and proceedings of the Sectaries in the
Island, and to report thereon to the House.” The report of this Committee,
with the evidence annexed, was presented on the 23d of December,
1828. It was to the following effect;</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>“Mr. Speaker,—Your Committee, appointed to inquire into the establishment
and proceedings of the Sectarians in this island,</p>

<p class='c010'>“Report—That they have taken the examinations of sundry persons, which
examinations are hereto annexed, and find that the principal object of the Sectarians
in this island is to extort money from their congregations by every possible
pretext, to obtain which, recourse has been had to the most indecent
expedients.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That in order to further this object, and to gain an ascendancy over the negro
mind, they inculcate the doctrines of equality and the rights of man—they
preach and teach sedition, even from the pulpit, and by misrepresentation and
falsehood endeavour to cast odium upon all the public authorities of this island,
not even excepting the representative of majesty itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That the consequences have been abject poverty, loss of comfort, and discontent
among the slaves frequenting their chapels, and deterioration of property to
their masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your committee therefore feel themselves bound to report—That the interference
of the missionaries between the master and slave is dangerous, and incompatible
with the political state of society in this island, and recommend to
the house to adopt the most positive and exemplary enactments to restrain them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The above report was referred to the Committee on the state of the Island,
and the house went in such Committee; and being resumed, Resolutions from
that Committee were reported and agreed to, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. That it be recommended to the House to agree to the Report from the Committee
appointed to inquire into the establishment of the Sectarians in this island,
presented to the House, with the addition of laying before the house the examination
of Mr. Samuel Bromley, a Baptist Minister, residing at St. Ann’s Bay,
respecting an instance stated by him to have occurred, of a master oppressing
his slave for attending the Baptist chapel, as it will exhibit the manner in which
he is disposed to treat the legitimate authority of the house, delegated to its
Committee, and they recommend it to the serious consideration of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. That it be recommended to the house to come to the following Resolution:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Resolved, that the conduct of Samuel Bromley, a Baptist Missionary, in refusing
to answer certain questions put to him, while under examination before a
Committee of this house, and in refusing to sign his deposition before such Committee,
is a breach of the privileges of this house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. That it be recommended to the house to agree to the Report of the Committee
appointed to inquire into the establishment and proceedings of the Sectarians,
presented to the house this day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. That it be recommended to the house to come to the following Resolution:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Resolved, That a copy of the Report of the Committee, appointed to inquire
into the establishment and proceedings of the Sectarians, and the examinations
taken before them, be forwarded to the Agent, with instructions to lay the same
before his Majesty’s Ministers, together with a copy of the 83d, 84th, and 85th
clauses of the Slave Law,” (viz. the persecuting clauses,) “disallowed in 1827,
and that the said Report and examinations and clauses be printed and distributed
by the Agent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These were followed by a farther resolution, “That Samuel Bromley,
Baptist Missionary, having been guilty of a breach of the privileges
of this house, be taken into the custody of the Serjeant at arms, and
that Mr. Speaker do issue his warrant accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We shall of course have an opportunity of soon seeing the evidence
which is to establish the immoral and destructive tendency of the labours
of the missionaries. In the mean time, it is plain from what has transpired
of it, in the columns of the Jamaica Newspapers, that it bears the
character of fabrication on its very front; and some of the journalists
have the boldness to affirm that it originates in the most unprincipled
hostility to religious instruction, and is supported by the most unblushing
perjury. And are the religious bodies quietly to submit to such
proceedings? Are they to have their chapels demolished, their missionaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>imprisoned in loathsome dungeons till disease has killed them, and
their characters falsely and iniquitously and inhumanly traduced, and
yet be silent? It may be questioned, whether, had they acted with becoming
firmness on former occasions, and made the appeal which became
them to the authorities of the state, the evils which now threaten
the suppression of their missions might not have been averted. In any
case, they seem now bound, if they would not be accessories to crime, to
assert the rights, and protect the persons, nay the very lives of their
missionaries; and above all to vindicate, to the wretched slaves, the
privilege of freely hearing the word of God, and of worshipping and
serving Him in peace. Is there any consideration which can induce
them to protect themselves and their congregations against insult and
injury, and intolerance, and persecution, in this country, which does not
render it still more imperiously their duty to put forth their whole energies
in shielding their helpless and unprotected brethren, in the Colonies,
from the arm of the persecutor? If they shrink from this duty theirs
will be the responsibility!</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>5. <span class='sc'>Cape of Good Hope—Society for redeeming Slaves.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A Society has been formed under the patronage of the Governor,
“<i>for aiding deserving slaves and slave children to purchase their
freedom</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The circumstance of a family of slaves in Cape Town having been
assisted in obtaining their freedom by the pecuniary aid of a few benevolent
individuals, suggested the benefits which might result from the
formation of a society for such and similar purposes.</p>

<p class='c013'>To carry this into effect, a meeting of some friends to the object
took place on the 27th of June, 1828, when a few resolutions were
passed, a list opened, and a provisional committee appointed to receive
subscriptions, and prepare for a general meeting of subscribers, which
was held on the 24th of July.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides the necessary organization of the Society, the resolutions
then adopted prescribe that young female slaves shall be emancipated
in preference to others; and that a preference shall also be given to
slaves who are members of a Christian community.</p>

<p class='c013'>Subscriptions are solicited from England and India. We have no
room for any extracts from the Address: what we have said will shew
the general character and purposes of the institution. The Address
itself certainly partakes more of the peculiarity of colonial logic, and
sympathizes more with the feelings and prejudices of slave-holders
than suits our taste or judgment. At the same time, we must leave
men to do good in their own way, only taking care that, in aiding
or countenancing their benevolence, we do not compromise our own
principles, or give a sanction to theirs, whereinsoever they fall short of
the standard of right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It appears that the Society had succeeded in redeeming six individuals.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
